Todos:
    1. Take a list of suburbs to report weather obs for and output json to either file or console
    2. Develop a UI to enter parameters and present responses  
    3. Allow setting of a timer to automate how frequently and how many iterations to report on (e.g vmstat)
    4. After getting above working make a cloud API for this and run from Azure/AWS
